# Economic Data Analysis with Fred & Pandas

This project is a collection of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to pull, clean, and analyze economic data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) using Python and the `pandas` library.

The notebooks cover topics such as:

- Retrieving data from FRED using the `fredapi` library
- Cleaning and formatting data with `pandas`
- Plotting time-series data with `matplotlib` and `plotly`
- Combining multiple data series into a single DataFrame for analysis
- Discovering insights from economic data

## Getting Started

To run the notebooks in this repository, you will need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `plotly`
- `fredapi`

You will also need to obtain a FRED API key from the [FRED website](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/). Once you have your API key, you can insert it into the notebook where indicated.
